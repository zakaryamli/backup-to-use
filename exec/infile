Hey guys .
m wondering if there is a faster way to transfer larger data from phone to computer instead of FTP or Cable
jeffy [afatimi]
 â€” 
Yesterday at 12:43 PM
if I wanna transfer few large files I usually start an http server in my pc and download the stuff I want from the phone 
la kano bzaf go with cable
cause u have to go and manually download rach one individually, speed is uncomparable tho

I'm looking for a lightweight and user-friendly Linux distro that doesn't consume much memory. Any recommendations?

Yesterday at 6:59 PM
how much lightweight we're talking about here ?

Yesterday at 7:01 PM
Nothing fancy, just be able to run vscode and it's extensions, and a few Firefox tabs
jeffy [afatimi]

I'd always recommend linux mint cinammon, which is as user-friendly as it can get, but if your hardware can't handle that (which i doubt), I'd go with linux mint xfce or Lubuntu
